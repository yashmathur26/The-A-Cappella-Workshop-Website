Yep—I see it. You’ve got multiple sections on the homepage each painting their own gradient/overlay (e.g., from-emerald-400/8 via-green-400/4 to-teal-400/8, section-specific bg-*, a “loading” block with its own background). That creates visible seams between “Welcome to Camp,” the hero, and loading text.

Below is a copy-paste Replit Agent prompt that will fix it the right way: make one global app background applied once at the layout/body level, then make every section transparent so the single background shines through. It also standardizes the loading/skeleton so it doesn’t inject a different bg.

✅ Replit Agent Prompt (paste this verbatim)

Title: Make homepage background perfectly continuous (single global gradient)

Do:

Create a single reusable app background and apply it globally (no section-level gradients).

Remove/replace any per-section bg-*, from-* via-* to-*, overlay divs, or dark panels that cause seams.

Ensure the “Welcome to Camp” section and the loading/skeleton components are transparent so the global bg shows through.

Apply identical logic to both Lexington and Newton homepage variants.

Steps & Exact Edits:

A. Define a single global background

Edit client/src/styles/globals.css (or the main CSS imported by the app). If it doesn’t exist, create it and ensure it’s imported in your app entry (e.g., client/src/main.tsx or client/src/index.css):

:root {
  /* Tuned for your current palette (emerald/teal) */
  --app-bg: radial-gradient(1200px 600px at 20% -10%, rgba(16,185,129,0.12) 0%, rgba(20,83,45,0.08) 35%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 70%),
             linear-gradient(to bottom, #041a14 0%, #07231b 35%, #0a291f 60%, #0d2f23 100%);
}

html, body, #root, #__next {
  height: 100%;
}

body {
  background: var(--app-bg);
  background-attachment: fixed;
  color: #e6f6ef; /* keep your current foreground contrast */
}

.bg-app {
  background: var(--app-bg);
  background-attachment: fixed;
}


B. (Optional, if using Tailwind) add a named background

Edit tailwind.config.js:

theme: {
  extend: {
    backgroundImage: {
      'app': 'var(--app-bg)',
    },
  },
}


Rebuild so bg-app is available.

C. Apply the global background once

In the top-level layout (client/src/App.tsx, client/src/pages/_app.tsx, or your root layout component), wrap the app:

export default function AppLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-app bg-fixed">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}


If you already set body to the background in CSS, the wrapper is optional; but keep one of these—not both.

D. Remove per-section backgrounds & overlays

In client/src/pages/home.tsx (and the Newton/Lexington variants, e.g., home.tsx, home.newton.tsx):

Delete any section-level gradient classes like from-emerald-400/8 via-green-400/4 to-teal-400/8, bg-emerald-*, bg-teal-*, bg-gradient-*, and any overlay <div className="absolute ... bg-.../...">.

Replace them with transparent section containers:

<section className="relative w-full py-16 md:py-24 bg-transparent">
  {/* content */}
</section>


If a card/panel needs contrast, give the card a subtle surface color—not the section:

<div className="rounded-2xl border border-white/10 bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-sm p-6">
  {/* card content */}
</div>


E. Normalize the hero & “Welcome to Camp”

In the hero/top banner component: remove any extra absolute overlay with its own gradient. Keep text/button containers transparent. If you want a vignette, add a very light inner shadow on the hero only:

<div className="relative">
  <div className="absolute inset-0 pointer-events-none shadow-[inset_0_-120px_120px_-60px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]"></div>
  {/* hero content */}
</div>


F. Fix the loading/skeleton background

Locate skeleton/loading components (search for Skeleton, Loading, animate-pulse, or containers with bg-gray-*/bg-slate-* around loading text).

Make wrappers transparent; only the bars shimmer:

<div className="bg-transparent">
  <div className="h-4 w-40 rounded-md bg-white/10 animate-pulse" />
</div>


Remove any bg-* on the parent that introduces a different panel color.

G. Remove duplicate page-specific gradients

Search and eliminate leftover gradient/overlay usages:

Find in repo:

from-emerald

via-green

to-teal

bg-gradient-

bg-emerald-

bg-teal-

overlay, backdrop, linear-gradient( in JSX/CSS

For each, either delete or change to bg-transparent, unless it is a card surface (keep those subtle: bg-white/5, border-white/10).

H. Verify both site variants

Confirm Newton and Lexington home pages share the same background behavior. If there are per-location wrappers (e.g., a LocationLayout), ensure they don’t add their own background.

I. Visual pass

Check in the preview: scroll from top hero → “Welcome to Camp” → any loading state. There should be zero color jumps. If a seam remains, inspect the element and remove the specific bg-* or overlay on that section.

Acceptance Criteria:

The homepage has one continuous background with no visible seams between sections.

Loading/skeleton states do not introduce new background colors.

Both Newton and Lexington variants use the same global background and section transparency.

Cards/panels look consistent using bg-white/5 + border-white/10, not section-wide backgrounds.

Why this fixes the bug

Right now, each section (and the loading block) paints its own background/gradient. Even tiny opacity or hue differences create visible banding. By moving the gradient to a single global layer and making sections transparent, the page scrolls over one canvas—no more mid-page color switches.

If you want, I can also suggest a radial + linear combo tuned to your exact brand colors after I see your Tailwind palette.
